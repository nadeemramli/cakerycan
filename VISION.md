# CakeryCan Project Vision

## Overview
CakeryCan is an e-commerce platform specialized for bakeries and cake shops, with a focus on providing a seamless ordering experience for customers while giving business owners powerful tools to manage their operations.

The front-end would be hosted as cakerycan.com and the admin panel would be hosted as order.cakerycan.com.

The cakerycan.com, would have a functional e-commerce site (homepage, browse menu, order flow, payment gateway, thank you page, about us, blogs etc for SEO)

While the order.cakerycan.com is the back-end, this is where we store the user data when they order, we also update our stock management here, the business operation also will refer here for managing the order etc. 

## Core Purpose
To bridge the gap between small-to-medium bakery businesses and their customers through an intuitive digital platform that handles the complete customer journey while providing robust back-office capabilities.

The issue we have with a small startup is that our limitation with cost and logistics, so most small startup handle their own logistic, but to achieve this it's required to schedule their delivery through a comprehensive front-end order flow. The front-end was meant to cater that, not just able to show the menu and pricing effectively, but to also allow the customer to schedule their delivery.

This will then be in-sync with the back-end, where the business operation will refer here for managing the order etc. Business operator can see their order by day based of the user schedule, and also manage their stock management here.
